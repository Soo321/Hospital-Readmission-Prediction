# Hospital Readmission Prediction and Analysis
Identifying high-risk patients and improving post-discharge care using data analytics and predictive modeling.
## Project Overview

Hospital readmissions are costly and often preventable.  
This project explores patterns in patient data to:

- Identify high-risk patients based on inpatient history and clinical indicators  
- Analyze the relationship between discharge disposition and readmission risk  
- Develop a predictive model to estimate readmission likelihood  

> Goal: Provide actionable insights and tools to support hospital decision-making and reduce preventable readmissions.
